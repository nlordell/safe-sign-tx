# Safe Sign Transaction

A tiny static HTML page for signing Gnosis Safe transactions

## Building

Building the static page requires:

- POSIX environment, specifically `make` and `sed`
- [Deno](https://deno.land) for bundling JavaScript
- _Optionally_ [cURL](https://curl.se) for uploading to IPFS

```sh
make # builds dist/index.html static page
make ipfs # builds the static HTML page and uploads it to IPFS
make clean # cleans up the dist/ directory
```

## Starting

Starting it:
```
make host
```
